Events
======

Information sent to your program by an outside agent is an *event*.  Usually events involve user interaction with the program; clicking a button, choosing a menu option, clicking on an object in the scene, pressing a key, and resizing the canvas all generate events.

A program can detect a relevant event and take appropriate actions by *binding* a particular event to a function designed to respond to that input.
