VPython enables the creation of navigable realtime 3D animations, and supports 3D vector operations.  A web version is available at `webvpython.org <https://webvpython.org>`_. For Python package installation instructions see `vpython.org <https://vpython.org>`_.   

*This new version of the VPython documentation has been reorganized and made searchable.  We hope that you find it easier to use.  In the course of the reorganization, some errors have been corrected, but new errors have inevitably crept into the documentation.  Should you find an error, please report it to the one of the :doc:`user forums <resources>`.*
