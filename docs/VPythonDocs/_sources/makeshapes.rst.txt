Making New Objects
==================

   compound <compound>
   vertex, triangle, and quad <vertex>
   extrusion <extrusion>
   shapes and paths <shapes_and_paths>
   cloning an object <clone>

There are three ways to make a new shape: 

#. Compounding two or more existing objects:

	.. image:: images/compound.jpg

#. Constructing a new shape from vertices, triangles, and quads:

#. Extruding a 2D shape along a 3D path:

The shapes and paths libraries can be used with *extrusion* to make complex objects.

**Duplicating Objects**

Once an object has been created, a copy of it can be made with *clone*
