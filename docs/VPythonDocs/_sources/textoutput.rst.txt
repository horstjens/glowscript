Text Output
===========

The following options offer ways to output ordinary text in fields *outside* the canvas.  If instead you want to display 2D text inside the graphical canvas, see :doc:`label`. If you want to display 3D text, see :doc:`text`.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   print
   wtext
   webvpython only <arcanetext>
   LaTeX math display <latexmath>

Using the *print()* command to display text in a scrolling text area is the simplest option, and is generally the method of choice.

*wtext* is used to update text (such as changing values) in a title or caption, without scrolling.
