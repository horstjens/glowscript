Once you have created an object, you can make copies of it using **clone**.  All properties of the new object will be exactly the same as those of the original. All objects *other than triangles and quads* can be cloned. *Clone* is actually a method of objects, hence the syntax:

.. py:function:: mycopy = myobject.clone(pos=vec(0,2,0), canvas=scene2 )

   :param pos: The position of the new object.
   :type pos: vector
   :param canvas: **Not available for compound or extrusion objects.** The canvas to which the new object should belong. Default is *scene* or current canvas.
   :type canvas: object

Additional parameters:

The new object has all the usual attributes of its class: color, size, etc.
