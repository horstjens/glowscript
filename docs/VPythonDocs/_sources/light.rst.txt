Lights
========

.. image:: images/lights.png

The image above shows a white sphere illuminated by a green distant light (at upper right) and a red local light (lower left).

Objects in a VPython scene must be illuminated to be visible.  There can be three kinds of lighting in a VPython scene: 

* Distant lights--point-like lights far away (like the Sun)
* Local lights--lights close to the objects in the scene
* Ambient light--uniform diffuse light that illuminates all objects equally

Some care must be taken in changing the illumination in a scene, since if the total lighting intensity exceeds 1 anywhere in the scene the results are unpredictable.


distant_light
-------------

.. py:function:: distant_light( direction=vec(0,-1,0), color=color.orange )

	:param direction: A vector specifying the direction of the light relative to the origin
	:type direction: vector
	:param color: The color of the light emitted.
	:type color: vector

By default there are automatically two distant lights in a VPython scene. 

	* One distant_light has direction < 0.22, 0.44, 0.88> and is a slightly dim white: color.white*0.8
	* The second distant_light has direction < -0.88, -0.22, -0.44> and is a dimmer white: color.white*0.3

local_light
-----------

.. py:function:: local_light( pos=vec(-3, 1, -2), color=color.yellow )

	:param pos: The location of the local_light.
	:type pos: vector
	:param color: The color of the light emitted.
	:type color: vector

A local light can look like a lamp if you put an emissive object at the location of the light.

scene.ambient
-------------

By default the ambient light is very dim, with color color.white*0.2. You can set *scene.ambient* to any color, but note that if the total light intensity becomes greater than 1, results may be unpredictable.

scene.lights
------------

*scene.lights* is a list of the lights in the scene. To see the attributes of the lights:

::

	for i in range( 0, len(scene.lights) ):
		LL = scene.lights[i]
		print( LL.pos, LL.direction, LL.color )

For a distant_light, *pos* will be undefined, as will *direction* for a local_light.

To delete all lights from a scene, set *scene.lights* to an empty list:

``scene.lights=[]``

Color of lights
---------------

If you create a light that is not white, what you see may be very different.  A green light can make a white sphere look green and a red sphere look very dark (since the red sphere absorbs green light).
