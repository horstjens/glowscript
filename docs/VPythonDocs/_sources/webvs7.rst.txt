Web VPython vs. the vpython module
==================================

There are two ways to use VPython:

#. WebVPython, the web version, runs in a browser and requires no software installation.  WebVPython is faster that Python (sometimes as much as a factor of 30), because it is transpiled to JavaScript before running.  However the web version does not provide access to Python modules such as numpy, pandas, etc.

#. vpython is a Python module that can be installed if you have a Python installation, such as Anaconda, on your computer already. Once installed, you can import the vpython module like any other module.  The graphical display will appear in a browser window when you run a program.  The vpython module may also be imported in a Jupyter notebook.
